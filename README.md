Still a simple and small machine learning framework written in C language. Might grow into something more bigger if I stay interested in the project. No promises.

Inspired by awesome [Tsoding Daily](https://youtu.be/L1TbWe8bVOc) Machine Learning videos.

Next task is to implement gradient descent algorithm with backpropagation.

The ideal goal would be implement original [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) or [GPT](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY) model architecture in C language some day.
